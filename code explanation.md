we arrived at that code through the following steps

We define a function calculate_discount that takes two parameters: price and discount_percent.
Inside the function, we check if the discount percentage is 20% or higher. If it is, we calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price to get the final price.
If the discount percentage is less than 20%, we simply return the original price.
We prompt the user to enter the original price and discount percentage using the input function.
We call the calculate_discount function with the user-input values and store the result in the final_price variable.
Finally, we print the final price, including a message indicating whether a discount was applied or not.
